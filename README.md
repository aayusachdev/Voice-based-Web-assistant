Voice-based web assistant where-in the webapp recognizes the user from a real-time video stream and greets the user with “Hello [Name]”.

How it Works?

1. Click on Start Video Recording on HomePage
2. Allow Webcam usage and start the Video stream
3. If a user is recognized, username will come(text+audio) otherwise he will be greeted as an Unknown User.

Future Enhancements:

1. Add more users in the Face Profile.
2. The volume button should be auto-pressed.
